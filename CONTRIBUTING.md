# Contributing
All contributions must follow these rules:
1. Content should be submitted using a PR against the README.md file
2. All commit messages must be "Initial commit" (any case is fine)
3. No racist, anti-LGBTQIA+, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory content or discussion. I *will* call you a fucko, then deny your PR and block you
4. No useful tools, links, or repositories UNLESS they have a vulgar or offensive name
5. All linked content must be on GitHub
6. Some content, such as fizzbuzz files, may be redundant to other repositories, and I may suggest you contribute them elsewhere (see [https://github.com/Plazmaz/awful-gitposts#related-lists](https://github.com/Plazmaz/awful-gitposts#related-lists))
